## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Codex Chat Completions Routing**: Codex providers can now be served by upstreams that only speak the OpenAI Chat Completions API. CC Switch's local proxy converts Codex's outgoing Responses requests into Chat Completions and rebuilds the Chat response (both JSON and SSE) back into Responses shape, preserving `reasoning_content`, inline `<think>` blocks, streamed reasoning summaries, tool calls, and `previous_response_id` follow-ups. A bounded Codex Chat history cache restores tool calls before their tool outputs.
- **22 Codex Third-Party Provider Presets with Chat Routing**: Enabled Chat Completions routing with explicit model catalogs for major Chinese/Asian providers — DeepSeek, Zhipu GLM (+ en), Kimi, MiniMax (+ en), StepFun (+ en), Baidu Qianfan Coding Plan, Bailian, ModelScope, Longcat, BaiLing, Xiaomi MiMo (+ Token Plan), Volcengine Agentplan, BytePlus, DouBao Seed, SiliconFlow (+ en), Novita AI, and Nvidia. Each preset declares its context window so the UI can size the model-mapping rows.
- **Codex Model Mapping Table**: Codex provider forms now expose a model catalog (model + display name + context window per row) that is the single source of truth for the upstream model list, projected to `~/.codex/cc-switch-model-catalog.json`.
- **Codex Chat Providers in Stream Check**: Stream Check now probes Chat-format Codex providers against `/chat/completions` with a Chat-shaped body instead of `/v1/responses`, and aligns its URL fallback order with the production `CodexAdapter` (origin-only base URLs hit `/v1/<endpoint>` first) so a non-404 error on the bare path no longer flags a working provider as down.
- **Codex Chat Reasoning Auto-Detection**: When a Codex provider is served through Chat Completions routing, CC Switch now auto-detects the upstream's reasoning interface from its name, base URL, and model — injecting the correct thinking parameter (`thinking:{type}`, `enable_thinking`, `reasoning_split`, top-level `reasoning_effort`, or OpenRouter's native `reasoning:{effort}` object) with no manual setup. Aggregator/hosting platforms (OpenRouter, SiliconFlow) are matched platform-first, since the same model can expose different reasoning controls on different platforms. Providers that only expose a thinking on/off switch (Kimi, GLM, Qwen, MiniMax, MiMo, SiliconFlow) drop the effort *level* instead of forwarding an unsupported field — so changing Codex's reasoning effort has no effect for them — while providers with real effort tiers (DeepSeek, OpenRouter, and StepFun's `step-3.5-flash-2603` only) pass the level through. OpenRouter specifically uses the native `reasoning:{effort}` object, clamps `max` to `xhigh` (its enum has no `max`), and forwards an explicit `effort:"none"` so reasoning can be turned off.
- **Xiaomi MiMo Token Plan Presets**: Added Xiaomi MiMo Token Plan presets with specs aligned to the official documentation (#2803).
- **Claude Desktop Official Preset**: Added a Claude Desktop Official preset that restores the native Claude Desktop login, plus a localized Claude Desktop user guide (en / zh / ja).

### Changed

- **Codex Third-Party Providers Unified into a "custom" History Bucket**: Codex filters resume history by `model_provider`, so switching between provider-specific ids made past sessions appear to vanish. All third-party providers now normalize to a single stable `custom` bucket (reserved built-in ids like `openai` / `ollama` are preserved), with a one-shot device migration that rewrites historical JSONL sessions and the `state_5.sqlite` threads table and backs up originals under `~/.cc-switch/backups/codex-history-provider-migration-v1/`.
- **Codex Provider Form Simplified**: Removed the API Format selector from the Codex form (`wire_api` is always `responses`, so the selector misleadingly implied a protocol change); the model mapping table is now the only source of truth with no hidden default entries, and the form notes that a Codex restart is required after catalog changes since `model_catalog_json` is loaded at startup. Only the "Needs Local Routing" toggle remains.
- **Codex Local Routing Toggle Hints Rewritten**: Reframed the OFF / ON hints as action guidance (when to enable) rather than scenario descriptions, synced across zh / en / ja.
- **Homebrew Official Cask Installation**: Installation simplified to `brew install --cask cc-switch` now that CC Switch is in the official Homebrew repository; the personal-tap requirement was removed from all READMEs.

### Fixed

- **Codex Chat Error Responses Converted to Responses Envelope**: The Codex Chat-to-Responses bridge previously passed upstream error bodies through untouched, leaving Codex clients unable to recognize MiniMax `base_resp`, raw OpenAI Chat errors, or plain-text / HTML error pages. Errors are now regularized into the standard `{error: {message, type, code, param}}` envelope with the original HTTP status preserved; non-JSON bodies are wrapped and truncated to 1KB at a UTF-8 char boundary. Also fixed a pre-existing append-vs-insert bug that emitted a duplicate `Content-Type` header on rewritten JSON bodies.
- **Codex Mid-Stream System Messages Collapsed**: MiniMax's OpenAI-compatible endpoint strict-rejects any non-leading `system` message (error 2013). All `system` fragments are now collapsed into a single leading message (joined in original order), losslessly for permissive backends too.
- **Codex Model Catalog Wiped After Restart**: Editing the active Codex provider triggered a live read that omitted `modelCatalog`, so a subsequent save silently destroyed user-configured model mappings. Live reads now reverse-parse the on-disk catalog projection to round-trip the same shape the save path writes.
- **Codex Model Catalog Infinite Render Loop**: Broke a bidirectional sync cycle between the catalog table and its parent state that caused severe UI jittering when adding or editing entries.
- **Codex Chat Preserves User-Selected Catalog Model**: A model the client selects from the catalog (e.g. via `/model`) is no longer overwritten by `config.toml`'s default model.
- **Codex Chat Reasoning and Cache Stability**: Restored a unique call-id fallback when Codex omits or rewrites `previous_response_id`, stopped deriving cache identity from `previous_response_id`, and canonicalized parseable JSON string payloads in tool conversions for stable prefix-cache reuse.
- **Codex Chat Streaming Usage Recovered**: The Responses-to-Chat conversion now injects `stream_options.include_usage` (merging into any client-provided `stream_options`) when a request is streaming, so OpenAI-compatible upstreams like Kimi and MiniMax emit the trailing usage chunk again. Previously their streamed token / cost / cache stats were recorded as zero on the Codex Chat path.
- **Codex Chat Tool-Call Reasoning Backfill**: Thinking models like Kimi/Moonshot and DeepSeek reject an assistant message that carries `tool_calls` without a non-empty `reasoning_content`. When cross-turn history recovery misses (proxy restart, ambiguous `call_id`, or a turn with no upstream reasoning), a placeholder `reasoning_content` is now backfilled in a final pass — genuine trailing reasoning still attaches first — so the request no longer fails with `reasoning_content is missing in assistant tool call message`.
- **Managed-Account Claude Takeover Auth**: Managed-account providers (GitHub Copilot / Codex OAuth) now drop token env keys and write only the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` placeholder when taking over Claude Live config, with an outbound guard that refuses to send the `PROXY_MANAGED` placeholder upstream.
- **Gemini Native Tool-Call Robustness**: Fixed `functionResponse.name` resolution (422) and `thought_signature` replay (400) for synthesized tool-call IDs in long multi-turn sessions (#2814).
- **Session Log Subagent Token Accounting**: `collect_jsonl_files()` now scans subagent JSONL logs that were previously missed, so subagent token usage is counted in session cost (session-log mode only) (#2821).
- **Skills Install by Key**: Installing from skills.sh search results now uses the unique key instead of the directory name, so skills that share a directory name install the correct one (#2784); also fixed a skill sync copy fallback (#2791).
- **Usage Price Input Precision**: Reduced the price input step to 0.0001 so sub-cent costs like DeepSeek cache reads can be entered (#2793, closes #2503).
- **Ghostty Clean Window Launch**: Ghostty now opens a single clean window instead of cloning existing tabs, and other terminals open a new window via `open -na` (#2801, closes #2798).
- **Codex mise Detection**: Fixed Codex mise environment detection (#2822).
- **useEffect Race Condition**: Added an active-flag pattern to App.tsx effects to prevent listener leaks on unmount, and guarded against storing `undefined` language in localStorage (#2827).

### Removed

- **LionCC Sponsor and Presets**: Removed the LionCC sponsor entry and LionCCAPI presets across READMEs, provider configs, and locales (icon asset retained).

## [3.15.0] - 2026-05-16

Development since v3.14.1 focuses on a dedicated Claude Desktop surface with third-party provider switching through a proxy gateway, a large reverse-proxy hardening pass (reliability, retries, cache, takeover, Gemini/Vertex/Codex paths), expansion of the third-party provider preset catalog (BytePlus / Volcengine / ClaudeAPI / ClaudeCN / RunAPI / RelaxyCode / PatewayAI / Baidu Qianfan), role-based model mapping with a 1M context flag, Codex OAuth live model discovery, and a long tail of usage, OAuth, Codex, and session quality-of-life fixes.

**Stats**: 127 commits | 211 files changed | +17,980 insertions | -2,748 deletions

### Highlights

- **Claude Desktop becomes a first-class managed surface** with third-party provider switching through an in-app proxy gateway, role-based model mapping (sonnet / opus / haiku) with a 1M context flag, Copilot/Codex OAuth provider reuse, and 44 imported provider presets translated from the Claude Code catalog. Note: 20 Claude Desktop presets now default to direct mode instead of routing through the proxy — verify connectivity if you previously relied on proxy routing for these presets.
- **Major reverse-proxy hardening**: P0–P3 lifecycle, retry, failover, and rectifier patches; pooled HTTPS reuse for non-Anthropic backends; Codex/Responses cache hit-rate improvements; correct Anthropic ↔ OpenAI `tool_choice` mapping; Vertex AI URL preservation; Gemini path-based model extraction; takeover detection refinement; IPv6 listen address support.
- **Provider Ecosystem Expansion**: Added BytePlus, Volcengine Agentplan, ClaudeAPI, ClaudeCN, RunAPI, RelaxyCode, PatewayAI, and Baidu Qianfan Coding Plan partner presets; promoted DouBao Seed to partner status; routing-support badges now surface on provider cards.
- **Role-Based Model Mapping for Claude Code**: Display-name-aware sonnet / opus / haiku route mapping with a `supports1m` flag replaces the legacy `[1M]` suffix and decouples routing from raw model IDs.
- **Codex OAuth Live Model Discovery**: ChatGPT Codex providers now fetch the live model list from the ChatGPT backend on demand instead of relying on a static list.
- **Usage Dashboard Filter-Driven Hero**: A new filter-driven Hero card with cache-normalized totals replaces the legacy summary block, paired with cache-cost-semantics fixes that silence a noisy pricing warning storm.
- **DeepSeek tool-call reasoning and zero-usage final deltas**: DeepSeek tool calls now return `reasoning_content` alongside `tool_calls` (#2543), and the final `message_delta` event always includes a usage block (even when zero) so strict Anthropic clients no longer crash on `null` (#2485).

### Added

- **Claude Desktop Third-Party Provider Switching via Proxy Gateway**: Added a dedicated Claude Desktop surface that brokers third-party Claude providers through CC Switch's in-app proxy, with a routing-support badge for providers that need it, role-based model route mapping locked to `sonnet` / `opus` / `haiku`, Copilot/Codex OAuth provider reuse, a redesigned Claude Code import flow, app-switcher differentiation between "Claude Code" and "Claude Desktop", and 44 provider presets translated from the Claude Code catalog.
- **Routing Support Badges on Provider Cards**: Provider cards in both Claude Code and Codex panels now show a routing-support badge so users can tell at a glance which providers can be served through Local Routing.
- **Codex OAuth Live Model List**: ChatGPT Codex providers now fetch the current model list from the ChatGPT backend on demand, replacing the previously hardcoded selection.
- **Role-Based Model Mapping with 1M Flag**: Claude Code model mapping is now role-based (`sonnet` / `opus` / `haiku`) with display names and a `supports1m` flag, replacing the legacy `[1M]` suffix to decouple routing from raw model IDs.
- **Filter-Driven Usage Hero**: The usage dashboard's Hero summary is now filter-driven with cache-normalized totals so the figures line up with the active date range and provider filters.
- **Provider Form "Save Anyway" Prompt**: Softened provider form validation with a "save anyway" prompt so non-blocking input issues no longer prevent saving (#2307).
- **Universal Provider Duplicate Action**: Added a duplicate action for universal providers from the provider list (#2416).
- **Persisted Tauri Window State**: Window position and size now persist across launches (#2377).
- **Tray Icon Tooltip**: The system tray icon now shows a tooltip on hover for clearer at-a-glance state (#2417).
- **Warp Terminal Session Launch**: Added support for launching Warp and executing a saved session inside it (#2466).
- **DeepSeek `reasoning_content` for Tool Calls**: DeepSeek tool-calling responses now return `reasoning_content` together with `tool_calls` so callers can render both (#2543).
- **Baidu Qianfan Coding Plan for Claude Code**: Added a Baidu Qianfan Coding Plan preset for Claude Code (#2322).
- **Compshare Coding Plan Preset (Cross-App)**: Added Compshare Coding Plan preset across claude / codex / hermes / openclaw.
- **Partner Provider Presets**: Added BytePlus, Volcengine Agentplan, ClaudeAPI, ClaudeCN, RunAPI, RelaxyCode, and PatewayAI provider presets; promoted DouBao Seed to partner status with refreshed endpoint and links.
- **44 Claude Desktop Provider Presets**: Translated 44 provider presets from the Claude Code catalog into the new Claude Desktop surface.

### Changed

- **20 Claude Desktop Presets Switched from Proxy to Direct Mode**: 20 Claude Desktop presets now ship in direct mode instead of routing through the proxy by default, reducing setup friction for users who don't need proxy-specific compatibility shims. Verify connectivity if you previously relied on proxy routing for these presets.
- **Claude Desktop Operational Notes**: Switching a Claude Desktop provider now writes CC Switch's managed 3P profile and requires restarting Claude Desktop to take effect; proxy-mode providers require CC Switch Local Routing to stay running.
- **Failover / Local Routing Guardrails**: Failover controls now require the target app's Local Routing takeover to be enabled, and stopping only the proxy service is blocked while any app still depends on takeover state.
- **Usage Accounting Semantics**: Usage summaries now report cache-normalized real total tokens and cache hit rate; historical token and cost totals may shift after deduplication and pricing recalculation, but should be more accurate.
- **Provider Preset Rendering Order**: Provider preset lists now render in author-defined array order with partners prioritized at the top, replacing the previous implicit sort.
- **Model Mapping Hint Copy Simplified**: `modelMappingOffHint` was rewritten as action-oriented copy across zh / en / ja.
- **CC Switch Brand Surface Unified to ccswitch.io**: All in-app and README references now point at ccswitch.io as the sole official website; the release notes template also surfaces ccswitch.io.
- **Theme Switch Simplified**: Removed the circular reveal animation; theme changes are now an instant cross-fade.
- **Claude Code App Switcher Differentiation**: The app switcher now visually distinguishes "Claude Code" from "Claude Desktop" and uses the "Claude Code" label in the app visibility settings.
- **CI: Claude Review on Opus 4.7**: Upgraded the Claude review GitHub Action to Opus 4.7, tuned the prompt to reduce nitpick noise, added an `@claude` review-only Code Action, pinned PR head SHA for checkout, and dropped a `--max-turns 5` limit.
- **Dependency Bumps**: `actions/checkout` 4 → 6 (#2517), `pnpm/action-setup` 5 → 6 (#2518), `softprops/action-gh-release` 2 → 3 (#2519), `actions/stale` 9 → 10 (#2520).
- **DeepSeek Presets Switched to V4**: DeepSeek presets now ship V4 (flash / pro) with refreshed pricing seeds.
- **Codex 1M Context Toggle Hidden in Provider Edit Form**: The 1M context-window toggle is no longer surfaced in the Codex provider edit form to reduce knob count for a setting that has no effect in current Codex deployments.
- **OpenClaudeCode Migrated to MicuAPI Domain**: Updated the OpenClaudeCode preset to the MicuAPI domain; refreshed Micu API links to `micuapi.ai`.
- **CrazyRouter Endpoints Switched to `cn` Subdomain**: Updated CrazyRouter preset endpoints to the `cn` subdomain.
- **RelaxyCode Custom Icon**: Switched RelaxyCode preset icon to a custom `relaxcode.png` asset.
- **Kimi For Coding Doc URL**: Updated Kimi For Coding website URL to the `/code/docs/` path.
- **SiliconFlow International Site Shows USD**: Balance display now correctly shows USD for the SiliconFlow international site (was incorrectly displaying CNY).

### Fixed

- **OpenAI Responses API Usage Parsing Robustness**: Hardened `build_anthropic_usage_from_responses()` and the Responses → Anthropic SSE translator so a missing or malformed upstream `usage` no longer produces `"usage": null` in `message_delta`. This unblocks strict Anthropic clients (notably the VSCode Claude Code extension) that crashed with "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'output_tokens')" against providers such as Codex OAuth and DashScope's `compatible-mode/v1/responses` endpoint. Added OpenAI field-name fallbacks (`prompt_tokens` / `completion_tokens`), null/empty/partial object handling, and preserved cache token fields even when input/output tokens are missing (#2422).
- **Proxy Reliability Patches (P0–P3)**: Multiple rounds of routing, lifecycle, retry, and rectifier patches across the request-forwarder paths; extracted a shared `handle_rectifier_retry_failure` helper and a shared `auth_header_value` helper across provider adapters.
- **Proxy: Pooled HTTPS Connection Reuse**: Non-Anthropic backends now reuse pooled HTTPS connections instead of opening a fresh TLS session per request, materially reducing per-request latency.
- **Proxy: Forward Client HTTP Method**: The proxy forwards the client's actual HTTP method instead of hard-coding `POST`, so non-POST upstream endpoints (e.g. GET `/v1/models`) work correctly.
- **Proxy: Per-Attempt Counters and `max_retries` Wiring**: Client-request counters moved out of the per-attempt loop, and `AppProxyConfig.max_retries` is now correctly wired into the request forwarder.
- **Proxy: Failover Decision Refinements**: Refined failover decision logic in the forwarder so retryable / unretryable errors are classified more accurately.
- **Proxy: Takeover Detection Tightening**: Tightened takeover detection and use fallback restore when disabling takeover so leftover state no longer strands a provider.
- **Proxy: Anthropic ↔ OpenAI `tool_choice` Mapping**: Anthropic `tool_choice` is now correctly mapped to the OpenAI Chat nested form during format conversion.
- **Proxy: Gemini Request Model Extraction**: Gemini request model is now correctly extracted from the URI path (not the body) so transformed traffic reports the right model.
- **Proxy: Auth Header Error Handling**: `get_auth_headers` now returns `Result` instead of panicking on bad credentials.
- **Proxy: IPv6 Listen Address Validation**: The Proxy panel now accepts IPv6 listen addresses.
- **Proxy: Codex / Responses Cache Hit Rate**: Improved cache hit rate for Codex and OpenAI Responses requests by stabilizing cache key derivation; only emit `prompt_cache_key` when a real client-provided session identity is available so unrelated conversations no longer collapse onto a single key; canonicalize (sort) JSON keys in outgoing request bodies and `tool_call` arguments / `tool_result` content for byte-identical prefix-cache reuse; thread `session_id` into the usage logger for request correlation.
- **Proxy: JSON Schema Underscore Fields Preserved**: Private-parameter filtering now preserves underscore-prefixed field names inside JSON Schema name maps such as `properties`, `patternProperties`, `definitions`, and `$defs`, so user-defined schema keys like `_id` and `_meta` survive the filter.
- **Proxy: Read Tool Empty Pages**: Drop empty pages from `Read` tool inputs so providers don't reject the request (#2472).
- **Proxy: Per-Request Hot-Path Trim**: Trimmed per-request hot-path work and database wait time.
- **Proxy: Real Provider Model Names Under Takeover**: The Claude Code menu now exposes the real provider model names when running under takeover, instead of a stale alias.
- **Proxy: Zero Usage in Final Message Delta**: The final `message_delta` event always includes a usage block (even when zero) so strict Anthropic clients no longer crash on `null` (#2485).
- **Proxy: Streaming `message_delta` Deduplication**: Deduplicated streaming `message_delta` events that some upstreams emit twice (#2366).
- **Proxy: Scoped `reasoning_content` Preserved for Tool Calls**: Tool-call paths now correctly preserve the scoped `reasoning_content` field during transformation; Kimi / Moonshot OpenAI Chat compatibility paths keep the field while generic OpenAI-compatible requests stay free of it (#2367).
- **Proxy: Vertex AI Full URL Preserved**: Full Vertex AI URLs are no longer truncated during proxy forwarding (#2415).
- **Proxy: Leading Billing Header Stripped from System Content**: Strips the leading billing-header content that some upstreams prepend to the system message (#2350).
- **Proxy: Claude Auth Strategy from `ANTHROPIC_*` Env Var**: The Claude auth strategy is now derived from the actual `ANTHROPIC_*` env variable name rather than an opaque heuristic.
- **Third-Party Claude Providers: Disable Model Test**: Model probing is now disabled for third-party Claude providers where the gateway doesn't implement `/v1/models` consistently.
- **Model-Fetch: `/models` Subpath for Anthropic-Compatible Providers**: `/models` discovery now works for Anthropic-compatible subpath providers.
- **Copilot: Claude Model ID Resolution Against Live `/models`**: Copilot-backed providers now resolve Claude model IDs against the live `/models` list to avoid stale ID mismatches.
- **Codex: Skip `environment_context` Injection When Extracting Session Title**: Session title extraction no longer pulls in `environment_context` noise (#2439).
- **Codex: Hide Subagent Sessions**: Codex subagent sessions are now hidden from the main session list (#2445).
- **Codex Startup Live Import Duplication**: Fixed a duplicate-import bug in the Codex startup live-import path (#2590).
- **Codex Provider Switch History Drift**: Switching the active Codex provider no longer changes existing session history (#2349).
- **Codex Usage Log Message**: Corrected a misleading log message for Codex session usage (#2473).
- **Claude: Persist Max Effort via Env**: `max` effort now correctly persists via the env variable on restart (#2493).
- **Claude Desktop: Match Proxy Model Route Without `[1M]` Suffix**: Route matching no longer requires the legacy `[1M]` suffix.
- **Claude Desktop: Provider Form Focus Loss**: Fixed an input that lost focus while editing in the Claude Desktop provider form.
- **Claude Desktop: Spurious Proxy-Stopped Status Alert**: Removed an alert that fired spuriously when the proxy was intentionally stopped.
- **Claude Desktop: Empty Toolbar Capsule Hidden**: Hides the empty toolbar capsule when Claude Desktop is the active app.
- **UI: Monitor Badge Icon Centering**: Centered the Monitor badge icon in the app switcher.
- **Linux: Theme Selection Segfault**: Prevented selecting a theme from causing a segfault on Linux (#2502).
- **Terminal: iTerm Fallback on Cold Launch**: Prevented iTerm from being selected as a fallback on cold launch when not actually present (#2448).
- **Config: Sort JSON Keys Alphabetically**: Config writes now sort JSON keys alphabetically for deterministic output (#2469).
- **Import Existing Side-Effect Free**: Made "import existing" side-effect free (#2429).
- **Coding Plan: Zhipu Weekly Tier by Reset Time**: Corrected the Zhipu weekly tier name to match the actual reset time (#2420).
- **DashScope: Usage Parsing Robustness**: Hardened DashScope usage parsing so a malformed payload no longer crashes the VSCode Claude Code extension (#2425).
- **Usage: Prevent Double-Counting Between Proxy and Session-Log Sources**: Deduplicated usage records sourced from both the proxy and session logs.
- **Usage: Cache Cost Semantics + Pricing Warn Storm**: Corrected cache-cost semantics and silenced a noisy pricing warning storm that fired on every request.
- **CI: Frontend Formatting and Linux Clippy Restored**: Restored frontend formatting and Linux clippy checks in CI.
- **Proxy Test Helper Clippy Warning**: Fixed a clippy warning in the proxy test helper.

### Removed

- **Hermes Agent Usage Tracking Integration**: Removed the in-cycle Hermes Agent usage tracking integration after upstream behavior changes made it impractical to keep in sync. The integration was never enabled in any released version — a zero-cost rendering bug found during its development was fixed before the integration was rolled back.
- **Theme Switch Circular Reveal Animation**: Removed the circular reveal animation used during theme switching; the animation caused jank on slower compositors and added little visible value.
- **DDSHub Partner Integration**: Removed DDSHub as a partner preset and dropped the cross-link blurbs across READMEs.

### Docs

- **README Sponsor Refresh (zh / en / ja)**: Added BytePlus, ClaudeCN, RunAPI, and PatewayAI sponsor entries; cross-linked BytePlus and Volcengine entries; refreshed the Crazyrouter $2 credit claim flow, the Compshare blurb, the Right Code blurb, and other sponsor logos and listings; flattened the LionCC logo onto a white background; switched the Chinese README's sponsor logo to the Volcengine artwork; added Hermes Agent to the README subtitles.
- **Release Notes Template**: Surfaces `ccswitch.io` in the release notes template.
- **Brand Surface**: Documented `ccswitch.io` as the sole official website across READMEs and in-app references.

## [3.14.1] - 2026-04-23

Development since v3.14.0 focuses on Codex OAuth stability, tray usage visibility, Skills import/install reliability, Gemini session restore paths, and simplifying Hermes configuration health handling.

**Stats**: 13 commits | 48 files changed | +1,883 insertions | -808 deletions

### Added

- **Tray Usage Visibility**: System tray submenus now show cached usage for the current Claude / Codex / Gemini provider, including subscription and script-based usage summaries with utilization color markers. Tray-triggered refreshes are throttled, limited to visible apps, and synchronized back into React Query so the main window and tray share fresh usage data (#2184).
- **Tray Coding-Plan Usage (Kimi / Zhipu / MiniMax)**: System tray now renders 5-hour + weekly window usage for Chinese coding-plan providers using the same `🟢 h12% w80%` two-window layout as official subscription badges (worst utilization drives the emoji). Creating a Claude provider whose `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` matches a known coding-plan host now auto-injects `meta.usage_script`, so the tray lights up without opening the Usage Script modal. Existing `usage_script` values are preserved on update.
- **Codex OAuth FAST Mode**: Added an explicit FAST mode toggle for Codex OAuth-backed Claude providers. When enabled, converted Responses requests send `service_tier="priority"` for lower latency; the toggle stays off by default to avoid unexpectedly increasing ChatGPT quota consumption (#2210).

### Changed

- **Session and Settings Layout Polish**: Hardened the scroll-area viewport with width containment to fix horizontal overflow, and tightened app bottom spacing plus settings footer spacing so long session/settings views fit more cleanly (#2201).

### Removed

- **Hermes Config Health Scanner**: Removed the in-app Hermes config health scanner, warning banner, `scan_hermes_config_health` command, `HermesHealthWarning` type, and `HermesWriteOutcome.warnings` payload. CC Switch now keeps the Hermes surface focused on active provider display, provider switching defaults, memory editing, and launching the Hermes Web UI for deep configuration.

### Fixed

- **Codex OAuth Cache Routing**: Stabilized ChatGPT Codex reverse-proxy cache identity by using client-provided session IDs for `prompt_cache_key` and Codex session headers, preserving explicit cache keys, and avoiding generated UUID cache churn (#2218).
- **Codex OAuth Responses SSE Aggregation**: Non-streaming Anthropic clients now receive JSON even when the ChatGPT Codex upstream forces OpenAI Responses SSE; CC Switch aggregates the upstream SSE events before running the non-streaming transform (#2235).
- **Codex OAuth Stream Check Parity**: Stream checks now build Codex OAuth test requests with the same `store: false`, encrypted reasoning include, and provider FAST mode setting as production proxy requests (#2210).
- **Codex Model Extraction**: Replaced first-line regex matching with TOML parsing when reading Codex config models, so multiline TOML is handled correctly (#2227).
- **Model Quick-Set / One-Click Config**: Model quick-set updates now apply against the latest provider form config, preventing stale state from making one-click configuration fail (#2249).
- **Skills Import Duplicates**: The Skills import dialog disables actions while import is pending and the installed-skills cache deduplicates imported results by ID, preventing double-clicks from adding duplicate installed entries (#2139, #2211).
- **Root-Level Skill Repos**: Skill install and update flows now consistently resolve three source patterns: direct nested paths, install-name recursive search, and repository-root `SKILL.md` sources (#2231).
- **Gemini Session Restore Paths**: Gemini session scanning now reads `.project_root` metadata so restore flows can pass the original project directory when available (#2240).
- **Provider Hover Names**: Provider icons now expose the provider name on hover for inline SVG, image URL, and fallback initials render paths (#2237).

## [3.14.0] - 2026-04-21

Development since v3.13.0 focuses on onboarding Hermes Agent as a first-class managed app, rolling out Claude Opus 4.7 across the preset matrix, adding a Gemini Native API proxy, and sharpening session, usage, and proxy workflows.

**Stats**: 100 commits | 219 files changed | +20,548 insertions | -3,569 deletions

### Added

- **Hermes Agent Support (6th Managed App)**: Added Hermes Agent as a first-class managed app with database migration v9→v10, full Rust command surface, YAML-backed `~/.hermes/config.yaml` read/write with atomic backups, MCP sync, Skills sync, session manager with SQLite + JSONL support, and dedicated frontend panels. Supports four API protocols (`chat_completions`, `anthropic_messages`, `codex_responses`, `bedrock_converse`) aligned with Hermes Agent 0.10.0 schema. Read-only rendering for providers owned by the user-authored `providers:` dict, with deep configuration delegated to the Hermes Web UI.
- **Hermes Memory Panel**: Added a Memory panel for editing `MEMORY.md` and `USER.md` directly from CC Switch, with an enable switch, character-count limits, and a live save flow. Replaces the Prompts entry for Hermes.
- **Hermes Provider Presets**: Added ~50 Hermes provider presets spanning Nous Research, Shengsuanyun, OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Together AI, StepFun, Zhipu GLM, Bailian, Kimi, MiniMax, DouBao, BaiLing, ModelScope, KAT-Coder, PackyCode, Cubence, AIGoCode, RightCode, AICodeMirror, AICoding, CrazyRouter, SSSAiCode, Micu, CTok.ai, DDSHub, E-FlowCode, LionCCAPI, PIPELLM, Compshare, SiliconFlow, AiHubMix, DMXAPI, TheRouter, Novita, Nvidia, and Xiaomi MiMo.
- **Claude Opus 4.7 Support**: Added Claude Opus 4.7 with adaptive thinking whitelisting, per-million pricing seed, and Bedrock SKU (`anthropic.claude-opus-4-7` / `global.anthropic.claude-opus-4-7`, dropping the legacy `-v1` suffix). Migrated all aggregator and Bedrock presets to Opus 4.7 as the default Opus model.
- **Claude `max` Effort Tier**: Upgraded the Claude effort dropdown from `high` to `max` for extended reasoning capacity.
- **Gemini Native API Proxy**: Added `api_format = "gemini_native"` so the proxy can forward to Google's `generateContent` API with full streaming, schema conversion, and shadow request support. Adds `gemini_url.rs`, `gemini_schema.rs`, `gemini_shadow.rs`, `streaming_gemini.rs`, and `transform_gemini.rs` under the proxy providers module.
- **GitHub Copilot Enterprise Server**: Added GHES authentication and endpoint configuration for Copilot-backed Claude providers, plus thinking-block stripping before upstream to preserve premium interaction quota.
- **Session List Virtualization**: Virtualized the session list via `@tanstack/react-virtual` so long conversations (thousands of records) scroll smoothly; long session messages are now collapsed by default to reduce text layout cost.
- **Codex / OpenClaw Session Title Extraction**: Added meaningful title auto-extraction for Codex and OpenClaw sessions with 2-line display; strips OpenClaw `message_id` suffix noise.
- **Usage Date Range Picker**: Added a date range selector to the usage dashboard with preset tabs (Today / 1d / 7d / 14d / 30d), a custom date + time calendar picker, and a page-jump input on paginated lists.
- **Model Mapping Quick-Set**: Added a quick-set button next to model mapping fields in provider forms for faster edits.
- **Stream Check Error Classification**: Classified Stream Check errors and surfaced them as color-coded toasts; refreshed default probe models and added explicit detection for "model not found" responses.
- **Block Official Provider Switching During Local Routing**: Blocks switching to official providers while Local Routing is active, since routing official API traffic through the local proxy carries account-suspension risk. A warning toast surfaces the block.
- **Pricing Database Refresh (v8 → v9)**: Added ~50 new model pricing entries and corrected stale prices via a reseed-on-migration step, including Claude 4.7, Opus 4.7 Adaptive Thinking, Grok 4, Qwen 3.5/3.6, MiniMax M2.5/M2.7, Doubao Seed 2.0 series, and GLM-5/5.1. DeepSeek and Kimi K2.5 prices updated.
- **Application-Level Window Controls**: Added an opt-in setting to render CC Switch's own minimize / toggle-maximize / close buttons instead of the system decorations, materially improving the experience on Linux Wayland where compositor-drawn buttons can become inert.
- **Hermes in Unified Skills Management**: Added Hermes to the unified Skills surface; skill install, enable, and filter now cover the Hermes app alongside Claude / Codex / Gemini / OpenCode / OpenClaw.
- **OpenClaw Config Directory Override**: Added a settings option to point CC Switch at a custom `openclaw.json` location.
- **Hermes Config Directory Override**: Added a settings option to point CC Switch at a custom `~/.hermes/config.yaml` location, backed by data-driven dispatch.
- **StepFun Step Plan Preset**: Added StepFun Step Plan (EN/ZH) provider presets.
- **New API Usage Script Template**: Added a User-Agent header to the New API usage script template for better upstream compatibility.
- **Launch Hermes Dashboard from Toolbar**: When the Hermes Web UI probe fails, the toolbar entry now offers to run `hermes dashboard` in the user's preferred terminal via a temp bash/batch script. `hermes dashboard` opens the browser itself once ready, so no polling is required. Also corrects the stale `hermes web` hint in the offline toast (the real command is `hermes dashboard`) and reorders Linux terminal detection to try `which` before stat'ing `/usr/bin`, `/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`.
- **LemonData Provider Preset (All Six Apps)**: Registered LemonData as a third-party partner preset across Claude, Codex, Gemini, OpenCode, OpenClaw, and Hermes, with icon assets and zh/en/ja partner-promotion copy. Claude uses `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` auth; OpenAI-compatible apps target `gpt-5.4`.
- **DDSHub Codex Preset**: Added a Codex-compatible endpoint for DDSHub at the same host as its Claude service; base URL omits the `/v1` suffix because the gateway auto-routes OpenAI SDK paths.

### Changed

- **"Local Proxy Takeover" → "Local Routing"**: Unified terminology across UI copy, README, and docs in all three locales. Functional behavior is unchanged.
- **Hermes `Auto` api_mode Removed**: Users must now pick an explicit protocol; new deeplinks default to `chat_completions`. Eliminates URL-based heuristic surprises.
- **Hermes Provider Form**: Added an API mode dropdown and per-provider model editor; bound per-provider models to the top-level `model:` when switching active providers.
- **Hermes Deep Config Delegation**: Deep YAML knobs are now delegated to the Hermes Web UI via a direct launch action, rather than duplicated in the CC Switch form.
- **`ANTHROPIC_REASONING_MODEL` Removed from Claude Quick-Set**: Decoupled the reasoning capability from model selection; the legacy field is no longer surfaced in the quick-set form.
- **Per-Provider Proxy Config Removed**: Consolidated into global Local Routing; the provider-level proxy toggle and associated storage are gone.
- **Unified Toolbar Icon Button Width**: Normalized icon-button widths across Claude / Codex / Gemini / OpenCode / OpenClaw / Hermes panels for a consistent header look.
- **Rust Toolchain Pinned to 1.95**: Adopted clippy 1.95 suggestions across the workspace and pinned the toolchain to prevent nightly drift.
- **Tray Menu ID Constant**: The tray identifier moved from the hardcoded string `"main"` to a `TRAY_ID` constant (`"cc-switch"`) across all call sites.
- **Copilot Request Classification**: Refined request routing inside the Copilot optimizer to further reduce unnecessary premium interaction consumption.
- **Usage Script Intranet Support**: Removed private-IP / suspicious-hostname blocking from usage scripts, unblocking enterprise intranet, Docker, and self-hosted API endpoints. Built-in templates still enforce HTTPS (except localhost) and same-origin checks; custom templates remain user-controlled with those request-URL checks skipped.
- **Failover Queue Notes**: Provider notes now appear in failover queue selectors and queue rows for easier identification across multi-provider queues.
- **Hermes Toolbar Layout**: Swapped the Hermes Web UI button from `ExternalLink` to `LayoutDashboard` (clicking may spawn `hermes dashboard` rather than just opening a URL), and moved MCP to the final toolbar slot so Hermes matches the Claude / Codex / Gemini / OpenCode layout.

### Fixed

- **Header Auto-Compact Latching After Maximize**: The toolbar no longer stays compacted after maximize/restore; compaction now reevaluates on size changes.
- **Hermes YAML Pollution & OAuth MCP Auth Drop**: Round-tripping through CC Switch no longer drops OAuth MCP `auth` blocks or pollutes unrelated YAML keys; guard tests added via `tests/hermes_roundtrip.rs`.
- **Hermes Active Provider Display**: Hermes UI now correctly surfaces the active provider and wires add / enable / remove actions.
- **Hermes Provider Persistence**: Providers persist under `custom_providers:` so `api_mode` and `model` survive restarts and config reloads.
- **Codex `cache_control` Preservation**: Preserve `cache_control` when merging system prompts during Codex format conversion (#1946).
- **Claude Prompt Cache Key Leak**: Stopped sending prompt cache keys during Claude chat conversions (#2003).
- **Proxy Hop-by-Hop Header Stripping**: Strip hop-by-hop response headers (Connection, Keep-Alive, Transfer-Encoding, etc.) per RFC 7230.
- **Permissive Proxy CORS Removed**: Removed the permissive CORS layer from the proxy (#1915).
- **Copilot Premium Consumption**: Further reduced unnecessary Copilot premium interaction consumption during pass-through traffic.
- **Backend Error Details in Proxy Toast**: Surface backend error payload details in proxy-related toast messages instead of a generic failure string.
- **Usage Log Deduplication**: Deduplicated proxy and session-log usage records so the same request is no longer double-counted; synced the request log time range with the dashboard's 1d / 7d / 30d selector.
- **Common Config Checkbox Persistence**: Checkbox state for Claude / Codex / Gemini common-config toggles now persists correctly across reopens.
- **Claude Plugin `settings.json` Sync**: Editing the current provider now syncs back to `settings.json` for the Claude plugin path.
- **Google Official Gemini Env Preservation**: Saving the Google Official Gemini provider no longer clobbers the `env` block.
- **OpenCode JSON5 Parser for Trailing Commas**: OpenCode config reads now tolerate trailing commas via a JSON5 parser.
- **Preset Refreshes**: Refreshed stale context windows for DeepSeek and Claude 1M; refreshed stale model IDs; backfilled Hermes model lists; fixed the Nous endpoint and replaced the Hermes placeholder icon with Nous brand artwork; pruned unused official Hermes presets.
- **Auto-Expand Collapsed Messages on Search Hit**: Collapsed messages now auto-expand when a search match lands inside hidden content.
- **Unknown Subscription Quota Tiers Hidden**: Provider cards no longer render unknown subscription quota tiers.
- **Weekly Limit Label Unified**: Aligned the weekly_limit tier label with the official 7-day naming across locales.
- **Root-Level Skill Repo Install**: Fixed skill installation when the repository root itself is a skill.
- **Session ID Parsing Clippy**: Removed a redundant closure in session ID parsing (clippy warning).
- **Usage Log Stat Dedup**: Deduplicated proxy-sourced and session-log-sourced usage records for accurate totals.
- **Stream Check Default Models Refresh**: Updated stream-check default probe models to match each vendor's current lineup.
- **Skills Import Sync**: Imported Skills are now immediately synced into enabled app directories instead of only being recorded in the database, so the UI no longer shows "installed" while the target app directory is missing the skill.
- **Ghostty Session Restore**: Fixed Ghostty session restore launch by using shell execution with `--working-directory`, avoiding `cwd` escaping issues when the path contains spaces or special characters.
- **Hermes Health Check Borrowing OpenClaw Schema**: Hermes providers were routed through `check_additive_app_stream` (the OpenClaw dispatcher), which reads camelCase `baseUrl` / `apiKey` / `api` and surfaced "OpenClaw provider is missing baseUrl" even when every Hermes field was filled. Introduced `check_hermes_stream` with Hermes-specific extractors that map `api_mode` (`chat_completions` / `anthropic_messages` / `codex_responses`) to the matching `check_claude_stream` `api_format`, and returns `bedrock_converse` as unsupported. `api_mode` is now resolved before URL / API key extraction, so `bedrock_converse` users see the real cause rather than a misleading "missing base_url".
- **Usage Query Modal for Hermes & OpenClaw**: `getProviderCredentials` now reads flat `settingsConfig` fields for Hermes (snake_case `base_url` / `api_key`) and OpenClaw (camelCase `baseUrl` / `apiKey`), so the "official balance" template auto-selects for matching providers like SiliconFlow. Also refactored the BALANCE and TOKEN_PLAN test paths to reuse the precomputed `providerCredentials` instead of re-reading `env.ANTHROPIC_*` directly, fixing the "empty key" error for non-Claude apps even when the key was configured.

### Docs

- **README Sponsor Updates**: Updated SiliconFlow signup bonus to ¥16, trimmed the SSSAiCode sponsor blurb, updated partner logos, and added LemonData as a new sponsor.
- **Global Proxy Hint Clarified**: Clarified the global proxy hint about local routing across all three locales.
- **Takeover → Routing Rename**: Renamed takeover docs to routing and updated anchors across all languages.
- **PIPELLM Website URL**: Updated the PIPELLM sponsor website URL to `code.pipellm.ai`.

### Breaking

- **Hermes requires explicit `api_mode`**: The `Auto` mode is gone; imported or deeplinked providers default to `chat_completions`. Users with prior `Auto` configs will be prompted to pick a protocol.
- **`ANTHROPIC_REASONING_MODEL` removed from Claude quick-set**: The legacy field is no longer exposed; existing settings are cleaned up automatically.
- **Per-provider proxy configuration removed**: Migrate to the global Local Routing setting. Existing per-provider proxy values are ignored.
- **Database schema bumped v9 → v10**: Adds `enabled_hermes` columns to `mcp_servers` and `skills` (auto-migrated with `DEFAULT 0`; no data loss).
- **Pricing table reseeded (v8 → v9)**: The `model_pricing` table is cleared and reseeded on first launch to pick up new models and corrected prices.
- **XCodeAPI preset removed**: Users of the XCodeAPI preset should switch to another provider.

---

## [3.13.0] - 2026-04-10

Development since v3.12.3 focuses on quota visibility, provider workflow upgrades, stronger proxy compatibility, and lower-overhead tray / session workflows.

### Added

- **Lightweight Mode**: Added a tray-only mode that destroys the main window and keeps CC Switch running from the system tray, with the window recreated when users reopen it.
- **Provider Model Auto-Fetch**: Added OpenAI-compatible `/v1/models` discovery for Claude, Codex, Gemini, OpenCode, and OpenClaw provider forms, including grouped dropdown selection and failure-specific error messages.
- **Quota & Balance Visibility**: Added inline quota or balance display for official Claude / Codex / Gemini providers, GitHub Copilot premium interactions, Codex OAuth providers, Token Plan providers (Kimi / Zhipu GLM / MiniMax), and official balance queries for DeepSeek, StepFun, SiliconFlow, OpenRouter, and Novita AI. Copilot / ChatGPT OAuth and CLI subscription quota now only auto-poll for the currently active provider, preventing unnecessary API calls and misleading displays on non-current cards.
- **Skills Discovery & Batch Updates**: Added SHA-256 based skill update detection, per-skill and batch update actions, a storage-location toggle between CC Switch and `~/.agents/skills`, and public `skills.sh` search integration.
- **Session Workflow Upgrades**: Added batch delete in Session Manager, a directory picker before launching Claude terminal restore commands, usage import from Claude / Codex / Gemini session logs without requiring proxy interception, and per-app usage filtering for Claude / Codex / Gemini dashboards.
- **Codex OAuth Reverse Proxy**: Added ChatGPT Plus / Pro based Codex OAuth reverse proxy support for Claude provider cards, including managed OAuth login and inline subscription quota display.
- **OpenCode / OpenClaw Stream Check Coverage**: Added OpenCode npm package mapping plus support for OpenClaw `openai-completions` and the remaining OpenClaw protocol variants in Stream Check.
- **Full URL Endpoint Mode**: Added a provider option that treats `base_url` as a complete upstream endpoint so proxy forwarding and stream checks can work with vendors that require nonstandard URL layouts.
- **OpenCode StepFun Step Plan Preset**: Added a StepFun Step Plan provider preset for OpenCode.
- **Copilot Interaction Optimizer**: Added request classification and routing logic to reduce unnecessary GitHub Copilot premium interaction consumption.
- **First-Run Welcome Dialog**: Added a one-time welcome dialog on fresh installs explaining how existing configuration is preserved as a default provider and how the bundled official preset enables one-click revert. Upgrade users are excluded.
- **Official Provider Seeding**: Added automatic seeding of Claude Official, OpenAI Official, and Google Official provider entries on startup, giving every user a one-click path back to the official endpoint.
- **OpenCode / OpenClaw Auto-Import**: Added automatic startup import of live OpenCode and OpenClaw provider configurations, matching the auto-import behavior already present for Claude, Codex, and Gemini.
- **Common Config Editor Guidance**: Added an informational guide and empty-state prompt to the Common Config snippet editor modal for Claude, Codex, and Gemini, with i18n support.
- **Common Config First-Run Notice**: Added a one-time informational dialog explaining Common Config Snippets when users first open the provider add/edit form.
- **Claude Session Titles**: Added meaningful title extraction for Claude sessions using a priority chain: custom-title metadata, first real user message, then directory basename fallback.
- **Session Search Highlighting**: Added keyword highlighting in session titles and messages during Session Manager search.
- **URL-Based Provider Icons**: Added a dual rendering mode to the icon system supporting Vite URL imports for large SVGs and raster images (PNG, JPG, WebP), keeping small SVGs inlined.
- **Kaku Terminal Support**: Added Kaku as a selectable terminal for session launch on macOS, reusing the WezTerm-compatible launch path.
- **OMO Slim Council Support**: Restored first-class council support as a built-in oh-my-opencode-slim agent with updated metadata and UI copy.
- **TheRouter Provider Preset**: Added TheRouter provider presets across Claude, Codex, Gemini, OpenCode, and OpenClaw.
- **DDSHub Provider Preset**: Added DDSHub as a third-party partner provider for Claude with icon and partner promotion text.
- **LionCCAPI Provider Preset**: Added LionCCAPI as a third-party partner provider across all five apps with anthropic-messages protocol for OpenCode and OpenClaw.
- **Shengsuanyun Provider Preset**: Added Shengsuanyun (胜算云) as an aggregator partner provider across all five apps with URL-based icon and localized display name.
- **PIPELLM Provider Preset**: Added PIPELLM provider preset across Claude, Codex, OpenCode, and OpenClaw with full model definitions and icon.
- **E-FlowCode Provider Preset**: Added E-FlowCode provider preset across all five apps with per-app protocol configuration.

### Changed

- **Tray Menu Organization**: Reworked the tray menu into per-app submenus to prevent overflow and make background provider switching scale better with larger provider lists.
- **Proxy Forwarding Stack**: Refactored proxy forwarding onto a Hyper-based client with transparent header forwarding, improved endpoint rewriting, and better support for dynamic upstream endpoints.
- **OAuth Auth Center UI Polish**: Tightened the Auth Center copy, layout, and icon presentation so the Codex OAuth login flow feels cleaner and less cluttered.
- **Provider Key Lifecycle & Live Sync**: Reworked additive provider create / rename / duplicate flows so live config writes, cleanup, and rollback stay consistent across OpenCode / OpenClaw and takeover scenarios.
- **Codex OAuth Defaults**: Updated the Codex OAuth preset to the GPT-5.4 model family.

### Fixed

- **Copilot Authentication & Proxy Compatibility**: Fixed GitHub Copilot authentication regressions, corrected enterprise / dynamic endpoint handling, repaired clipboard verification-code copying on macOS and Linux, and fixed Responses routing when Copilot-backed Claude providers target OpenAI models.
- **Streaming Parser Compatibility**: Fixed SSE parsing to accept fields with optional spaces, improving compatibility with non-strict streaming implementations.
- **UTF-8 Stream Chunk Boundaries**: Fixed intermittent garbled output (U+FFFD replacement characters) in Claude Code when multi-byte UTF-8 sequences such as Chinese characters or emoji were split across TCP stream chunks via the Copilot reverse proxy, by preserving incomplete trailing bytes across chunks in all four SSE streaming paths instead of lossy decoding.
- **Fragmented System Prompt Normalization**: Fixed strict OpenAI-compatible chat backends (Nvidia, Qwen-style) rejecting requests when converted Claude payloads contained multiple system messages, by merging system content into a single leading system message during the Anthropic → OpenAI chat transformation.
- **Provider Switch State Corruption**: Serialized per-app provider switches to prevent concurrent failover or hot-switch operations from leaving `is_current`, settings state, and live backup state out of sync.
- **Claude Takeover Live Config Drift**: Fixed provider edits while Claude takeover is active so live settings remain aligned with the latest provider state without breaking takeover restore behavior.
- **WebDAV Password Retention & Validation**: Fixed the WebDAV password field so saved credentials remain visible after refresh and treated `MKCOL 405` responses correctly during connection validation.
- **Provider Card Action States**: Fixed additive-mode highlight behavior, aligned usage display layout across provider cards, replaced hard proxy-switch blocking with a warning path, and disabled unsupported test / usage actions for Copilot and Codex OAuth cards.
- **Usage Accuracy & Pricing**: Fixed MiniMax quota math and 0%→100% progression, corrected CNY→USD pricing plus missing model definitions, improved Gemini session-log syncing, and resolved session-based usage entries being shown as unknown providers.
- **Usage Editor & Skills UI Regressions**: Fixed usage query fields being reset while editing extractor code, corrected broken `skills.sh` links and empty descriptions, and fixed auto-query defaults plus number-input clearing in usage configuration.
- **Chinese Skills Terminology**: Unified Skills-related labels across settings panels in the `zh` locale so storage and sync options use consistent wording.
- **Environment & Preset Compatibility**: Added Bun global bin detection in CLI scan, adapted to the oh-my-openagent rename with backward compatibility, corrected the OpenCode `kimi-for-coding` preset, gated Gemini keychain parsing to macOS, and fixed an OpenClaw serializer panic on empty collections.
- **Linux UI Unresponsive on Startup**: Fixed a bug where the window UI (including native title bar buttons) couldn't receive clicks on Linux until the user manually maximized and restored the window. Root causes: (1) Tauri webview did not acquire keyboard focus after `show()` on Linux, so the first click was consumed by X11/Wayland click-to-activate (Tauri #10746, wry #637); (2) GTK surface's input region failed to renegotiate on the `visible:false → show()` path under some WebKitGTK/compositor combinations, leaving the entire window unresponsive. Mitigations: set `WEBKIT_DISABLE_COMPOSITING_MODE=1` at startup, and added a new `linux_fix::nudge_main_window` helper that performs `set_focus` + a ±1px no-op resize ~200ms after show, equivalent to a visually invisible "maximize-and-restore". Wired into all window-re-show paths (normal startup, deeplink, single_instance, tray `show_main`, lightweight exit).
- **Linux Drag Region on Header**: Removed `data-tauri-drag-region` from the top header bar on Linux to avoid triggering `gtk_window_begin_move_drag` paths affected by Tauri #13440 under Wayland. macOS drag behavior is preserved.
- **OpenCode / OpenClaw Stream Check Edge Cases**: Fixed custom-header passthrough, OpenClaw custom auth-header detection, Bedrock error messaging, and OpenCode default `baseURL` fallback handling in Stream Check.
- **Duplicate Toast on Provider Switch**: Fixed double toast notifications (proxy-required warning followed by switch-success) when switching to Copilot, ChatGPT, or OpenAI-format providers with the proxy not running.
- **Session Search Accuracy & Chinese Support**: Fixed session search result truncation across providers and switched FlexSearch tokenizer to full mode for proper Chinese substring matching.
- **Adaptive Thinking Reasoning Effort**: Fixed `resolve_reasoning_effort()` mapping adaptive thinking to `xhigh` instead of incorrectly using `high` in OpenAI format conversions.
- **Thinking Model Fallback Display**: Fixed the Claude provider form showing an empty Thinking model field after saving only a main model by applying read-only fallback to ANTHROPIC_MODEL.
- **Auth Tab Localization**: Fixed missing i18n translation keys for the settings auth tab label across all locale bundles.
- **Schema Migration Guard**: Fixed database migrations failing when skills or model_pricing tables did not exist by adding table-existence checks before ALTER and UPDATE operations.

### Docs

- **User Manual Refresh**: Updated the EN / ZH / JA manuals for tray submenus, lightweight mode, provider model fetching, session management, workspace files, WebDAV v2 behavior, OpenCode / OpenClaw activation, and other provider workflow improvements.
- **Community & Contribution Docs**: Added `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, bilingual issue / PR templates, Dependabot config, and CI quality checks.
- **Release Notes Risk Notice**: Added a Copilot reverse proxy risk notice and anchored highlight links in the v3.12.3 release notes across all three languages.
- **Sponsor Partners**: Added Shengsuanyun, LionCC, and DDS as sponsor partners in README across all languages.

## [3.12.3] - 2026-03-24

Major release adding GitHub Copilot reverse proxy support, macOS code signing & Apple notarization, intelligent reasoning effort mapping for o-series models, skill backup/restore lifecycle, proxy gzip compression, and critical fixes for WebDAV password safety, tool message parsing, and dark mode.

**Stats**: 36 commits | 107 files changed | +9,124 insertions | -802 deletions

### Added

- **GitHub Copilot Reverse Proxy**: Full GitHub Copilot integration as a Claude Code provider via OAuth Device Code flow; includes multi-account management, automatic token refresh, Anthropic ↔ OpenAI format conversion, real-time model list fetching, and usage statistics (#930)
- **Copilot Auth Center**: New Auth Center panel in Settings for managing GitHub accounts globally, with per-provider account binding via `meta.authBinding`
- **Tool Search Toggle**: Added `ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH` env var support for Claude 2.1.76+; exposed as a checkbox in the provider Common Config editor (#930)
- **Reasoning Effort Mapping**: Two-tier `resolve_reasoning_effort()` for OpenAI o-series and GPT-5+ models — explicit `output_config.effort` takes priority, falling back to thinking `budget_tokens` thresholds (<4 000→low, 4 000–16 000→medium, ≥16 000→high); covers both Chat Completions and Responses API paths with 17 unit tests
- **OpenCode SQLite Backend**: Added SQLite session storage support for OpenCode alongside existing JSON backend; dual-backend scan with SQLite priority on ID conflicts, atomic session deletion, and path validation (#1401)
- **Skill Auto-Backup**: Skill files are automatically backed up to `~/.cc-switch/skill-backups/` before uninstall, with metadata preserved in `meta.json`; old backups pruned to keep at most 20
- **Skill Backup Restore & Delete**: Added list/restore/delete commands for skill backups; restore copies files back to SSOT, saves the DB record, and syncs to the current app with rollback on failure
- **macOS Code Signing & Notarization**: CI now imports an Apple Developer ID certificate, signs the universal binary, submits for Apple notarization, and staples the ticket to both `.app` and `.dmg`; a hard-fail verification step (`codesign --verify` + `spctl -a` + `stapler validate`) gates the release for both artifacts
- **Codex 1M Context Window Toggle**: One-click checkbox in Codex config editor to set `model_context_window = 1000000` with auto-populated `model_auto_compact_token_limit = 900000`; unchecking removes both fields
- **Disable Auto-Upgrade Toggle**: Added `DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER` env var checkbox in the Claude Common Config editor to prevent Claude Code from auto-upgrading

### Changed

- **Skills Cache Strategy**: Replaced `invalidateQueries` with direct `setQueryData` updates for skill install/uninstall/import operations; added `staleTime: Infinity` with `keepPreviousData` to eliminate loading flicker (#1573)
- **Proxy Gzip Compression**: Non-streaming proxy requests now auto-negotiate gzip compression instead of forcing `identity`; streaming requests conservatively keep `identity` to avoid SSE decompression errors
- **o1/o3 Model Compatibility**: Chat Completions proxy forwarding now correctly uses `max_completion_tokens` instead of `max_tokens` for OpenAI o-series models such as o1/o3/o4-mini (#1451)
- **OpenCode Model Variants**: Placed OpenCode model variants at top level instead of inside options for better discoverability (#1317)
- **Skills Import Flow**: Replaced implicit filesystem-based app inference with explicit `ImportSkillSelection` to prevent incorrect multi-app activation; added reconciliation to remove disabled/orphaned symlinks and MCP servers from live config
- **Claude 4.6 Context Window**: Updated Claude Opus 4.6 and Sonnet 4.6 context window from 200K to 1M across OpenClaw and OpenCode presets (GA release)
- **MiniMax Model Upgrade**: Updated MiniMax presets from M2.5 to M2.7 across Claude, OpenClaw, and OpenCode configurations with updated partner descriptions in all three locales
- **Xiaomi MiMo Model Upgrade**: Updated MiMo presets from mimo-v2-flash to mimo-v2-pro across all supported applications
- **AddProviderDialog Simplification**: Removed redundant OAuth tab, reducing dialog from 3 tabs to 2 (app-specific + universal)
- **Provider Form Advanced Options Collapse**: Model mapping, API format, and other advanced fields in the Claude provider form now auto-collapse when empty; auto-expands when any value is set or when a preset fills them in

### Fixed

- **WebDAV Password Silent Clear**: Fixed WebDAV password being silently wiped when ProviderList or UsageScriptModal saved settings by stripping `webdavSync` from frontend payloads and adding backend backfill logic in `merge_settings_for_save()` to preserve existing passwords
- **Tool Message Parsing**: Fixed tool_use/tool_result message classification across Claude (tool_result content blocks), Codex (function_call/function_call_output payloads), and Gemini (array content + toolCalls extraction) session providers (#1401)
- **Dark Mode Selector**: Changed Tailwind `darkMode` from `["selector", "class"]` to `["selector", ".dark"]` to ensure correct dark mode activation (#1596)
- **Copilot Request Fingerprint**: Unified Copilot request fingerprint headers across all API call sites to prevent User-Agent leakage and stream check mismatches
- **o-series Responses API Tokens**: Kept Responses API on the correct `max_output_tokens` field for o-series models instead of incorrectly injecting `max_completion_tokens`
- **Provider Form Double Submit**: Prevented duplicate submissions on rapid button clicks in provider add/edit forms (#1352)
- **Ghostty Session Restore**: Fixed Claude session restore in Ghostty terminal (#1506)
- **Skill ZIP Import Extension**: Added `.skill` file extension support in ZIP import dialog (#1240, #1455)
- **Skill ZIP Install Target App**: ZIP skill installs now use the currently active app instead of always defaulting to Claude
- **OpenClaw Active Card Highlight**: Fixed active OpenClaw provider card not being highlighted (#1419)
- **Responsive Layout with TOC**: Improved responsive design when TOC title exists (#1491)
- **Import Skills Dialog White Screen**: Added missing TooltipProvider in ImportSkillsDialog to prevent runtime crash when opening the dialog
- **Panel Bottom Blank Area**: Replaced hardcoded `h-[calc(100vh-8rem)]` with `flex-1 min-h-0` across all content panels to eliminate bottom gap caused by mismatched offset values

### Docs

- **Pricing Model ID Normalization**: Added documentation section explaining model ID normalization rules (prefix stripping, suffix trimming, `@`→`-` replacement) in EN/ZH/JA user manuals (#1591)
- **macOS Signed & Notarized**: Removed all `xattr` workaround instructions and "unidentified developer" warnings from README, README_ZH, installation guides (EN/ZH/JA), and FAQ pages (EN/ZH/JA); replaced with "signed and notarized by Apple" messaging

## [3.12.2] - 2026-03-12

Post-v3.12.1 work focuses on Common Config safety during proxy takeover and more reliable Codex TOML editing.

**Stats**: 5 commits | 22 files changed | +1,716 insertions | -288 deletions

### Added

- **Empty State Guidance**: Improved first-run experience with detailed import instructions and a conditional Common Config snippet hint for Claude/Codex/Gemini providers

### Changed

- **Proxy Takeover Restore Flow**: Proxy takeover hot-switch and provider sync now refresh the restore backup instead of overwriting live config files, rebuilding effective provider settings with Common Config applied so rollback preserves the real user configuration
- **Codex TOML Editing Engine**: Refactored Codex `config.toml` updates onto shared section-aware TOML helpers in Rust and TypeScript, covering `base_url` and `model` field edits across provider forms and takeover cleanup
- **Common Config Initialization Lifecycle**: Startup now auto-extracts Common Config snippets from clean live configs before takeover restoration, tracks explicit "snippet cleared" state, and persists a one-time legacy migration flag to avoid repeated backfills

### Fixed

- **Common Config Loss During Takeover**: Fixed cases where proxy takeover could drop Common Config changes, overwrite live configs during sync, or produce incomplete restore snapshots when switching providers
- **Codex Restore Snapshot Preservation**: Fixed Codex takeover restore backups so existing `mcp_servers` blocks survive provider hot-switches instead of being discarded; changed MCP backup preservation from wholesale table replacement to per-server-id merge so provider/common-config MCP updates win on conflict while live-only servers are retained
- **Cleared Snippet Resurrection**: Fixed startup auto-extraction recreating Common Config snippets that users had intentionally cleared
- **Codex `base_url` Misplacement**: Fixed Codex `base_url` extraction and editing to target the active `[model_providers.<name>]` section instead of appending to the file tail or confusing `mcp_servers.*.base_url` entries for provider endpoints

## [3.11.1] - 2026-02-28

### Hotfix Release

This release reverts the Partial Key-Field Merging architecture introduced in v3.11.0, restoring the proven "full config overwrite + Common Config Snippet" mechanism, and fixes several UI and platform compatibility issues.

**Stats**: 8 commits | 52 files changed | +3,948 insertions | -1,411 deletions

### Reverted

- **Restore Full Config Overwrite + Common Config Snippet** (revert 992dda5c): Reverted the partial key-field merging refactoring from v3.11.0 due to critical issues — non-whitelisted custom fields were lost during provider switching, backfill permanently stripped non-key fields from the database, and the whitelist required constant maintenance. Restores full config snapshot write, Common Config Snippet UI and backend commands, and 6 frontend components/hooks

### Changed

- **Proxy Panel Layout**: Moved proxy on/off toggle from accordion header into panel content area, placed directly above app takeover options, ensuring users see takeover configuration immediately after enabling the proxy
- **Manual Import for OpenCode/OpenClaw**: Removed auto-import on startup; empty state now shows an "Import Current Config" button, consistent with Claude/Codex/Gemini behavior

### Fixed

- **"Follow System" Theme Not Auto-Updating**: Delegated to Tauri's native theme tracking (`set_window_theme(None)`) so the WebView's `prefers-color-scheme` media query stays in sync with OS theme changes
- **Compact Mode Cannot Exit**: Restored `flex-1` on `toolbarRef` so `useAutoCompact`'s exit condition triggers correctly based on available width instead of content width
- **Proxy Takeover Toast Shows {{app}}**: Added missing `app` interpolation parameter to i18next `t()` calls for proxy takeover enabled/disabled messages
- **Windows Protocol Handler Side Effects**: Disabled environment check and one-click install on Windows to prevent unintended protocol handler registration

---

### Changed

#### Architecture

- **Partial Key-Field Merging (⚠️ Breaking, reverted in v3.11.1)**: Provider switching now uses partial key-field merging instead of full config overwrite, preserving user's non-provider settings (plugins, MCP, permissions). The "Common Config Snippet" feature has been removed as it is no longer needed. Removes 6 frontend files and ~150 lines of backend dead code (#1098)
- **Manual Import**: Replaced auto-import on startup with manual “Import Current Config” button in empty state, reducing ~47 lines of startup code
- **OMO Variant Parameterization**: Eliminated ~250 lines of OMO/OMO Slim code duplication via `OmoVariant` struct with STANDARD/SLIM constants
- **OMO Common Config Removal**: Removed the two-layer merge system for OMO common config (-1,733 lines across 21 files)

#### Code Quality

- **ProviderForm Decomposition**: Extracted ProviderForm.tsx from 2,227 lines to 1,526 lines by splitting into 5 focused modules (opencodeFormUtils, useOmoModelSource, useOpencodeFormState, useOmoDraftState, useOpenclawFormState)
- **Shared MCP/Skills Components**: Extracted AppCountBar, AppToggleGroup, and ListItemRow shared components to eliminate duplication across MCP and Skills panels
- **OpenClaw TanStack Query Migration**: Migrated Env, Tools, and AgentsDefaults panels from manual useState/useEffect to centralized TanStack Query hooks

#### Settings Layout

- **Proxy Tab**: Split Advanced tab into dedicated Proxy tab (local proxy, failover, rectifiers, global outbound proxy); moved pricing config to Usage dashboard as collapsible accordion. SettingsPage reduced from ~716 to ~426 lines with 5-tab layout: General | Proxy | Advanced | Usage | About
- **Data Section Split**: Split data accordion into Import/Export and Cloud Sync sections for better discoverability

#### Terminal & Config

- **Unified Terminal Selection**: Consolidated terminal preference to global settings; added WezTerm support and terminal name mapping (iterm2 → iterm)
- **OpenClaw Agents Panel**: Primary model field set to read-only; detailed model fields (context window, max tokens, reasoning, cost) moved to advanced options
- **Claude Model Update**: Updated Claude model references from 4.5 to 4.6 across all provider presets

### Fixed

#### Critical

- **Windows Home Dir Regression**: Restored default home directory resolution on Windows to prevent providers/settings “disappearing” when `HOME` env var differs from the real user profile directory (Git/MSYS environments); auto-detects v3.10.3 legacy database location
- **Linux White Screen**: Disabled WebKitGTK hardware acceleration on AMD GPUs (Cezanne/Radeon Vega) to prevent EGL initialization failure causing blank screen on startup
- **OpenAI Beta Parameter**: Stopped appending `?beta=true` to OpenAI Chat Completions endpoints, fixing request failures for Nvidia and other `apiFormat=”openai_chat”` providers
- **Health Check Auth Mode**: Health check now respects provider's auth_mode setting instead of always using x-api-key header

#### Provider & Preset

- **OpenClaw /v1 Prefix**: Removed /v1 prefix from OpenClaw anthropic-messages presets to prevent double path (/v1/v1/messages) with Anthropic SDK auto-append
- **Opus Pricing**: Corrected Opus pricing from $15/$75 to $5/$25 and upgraded model ID to claude-opus-4-6
- **AIGoCode URLs**: Unified API base URL to https://api.aigocode.com across all apps; removed trailing /v1 suffix
- **Zhipu GLM**: Removed outdated partner status from Claude, OpenCode, and OpenClaw presets
- **API Key Visibility**: Restored API Key input field when creating new Claude providers (was incorrectly hidden for non-cloud_provider categories)

#### OMO / OMO Slim

- **OMO Slim Category Checks**: Added missing omo-slim category checks across add/form/mutation paths
- **OMO Slim Cache Invalidation**: Invalidate OMO Slim query cache after provider mutations to prevent stale UI state
- **OMO Recommended Models**: Synced agent/category recommended models with upstream sources; fixed provider/model format to pure model IDs
- **OMO Fill Feedback**: Added toast feedback when “Fill Recommended” button silently fails
- **OMO Last-Provider Restriction**: Removed last-provider deletion restriction for OMO/OMO Slim plugins
- **OpenCode Model Validation**: Reject saving OpenCode providers without at least one configured model

#### OpenClaw

- **OpenClaw P0-P3 Fixes**: Fixed 25 missing i18n keys, replaced key={index} with stable crypto.randomUUID(), excluded openclaw from ProxyToggle/FailoverToggle, added deep link merge_additive_config(), unified serde(flatten) naming, added directory existence checks, removed dead code, added duplicate key validation
- **OpenClaw Robustness**: Fixed EnvPanel visibleKeys using entry key names instead of array indices; added NaN guards; validated provider ID and model before import
- **OpenClaw i18n Dedup**: Merged duplicate openclaw i18n keys to restore provider form translations

#### Platform

- **Window Flash**: Prevented window flicker on silent startup (Windows)
- **Title Bar Theme**: Title bar now follows dark/light mode theme changes
- **Skills Path Separator**: Fixed path separator matching for skill installation status on Windows (supports both `/` and `\`)
- **WSL Conditional Compilation**: Added `#[cfg(target_os = “windows”)]` to WSL helper functions to eliminate dead_code warnings on non-Windows platforms

#### UI

- **Toolbar Clipping**: Removed toolbar height limit that was clipping AppSwitcher
- **Update Badge**: Show update badge instead of green check when a newer version is available
- **Session Button Visibility**: Only show Session Manager button for Claude and Codex apps
- **Directory Spacing**: Added vertical spacing between directory setting sections
- **Dark Mode Cards**: Unified SQL import/export card styling in dark mode
- **OpenClaw Scroll**: Enabled scrolling for OpenClaw configuration panel content

#### i18n & Localization

- **Session Manager i18n**: Replaced hardcoded Chinese strings with i18n keys for relative time, role labels, and UI elements
- **OpenClaw Default Model Label**: Renamed “Enable/Default” to “Set as Default / Current Default” with wider button
- **Daily Memory Sort**: Sort daily memory files by filename date (YYYY-MM-DD.md) instead of modification time
- **Backup Name i18n**: Use local time for backup file names

#### Other

- **Skill Doc URL**: Use actual branch from download_repo for documentation URL; switched from /tree/ to /blob/ pointing to SKILL.md
- **OpenCode Install Detection**: Added install.sh priority paths (OPENCODE_INSTALL_DIR > XDG_BIN_DIR > ~/bin > ~/.opencode/bin) with path dedup and cross-platform executable candidates
- **Provider Auto-Import**: Removed auto-import side effect from useProvidersQuery queryFn; users now trigger import manually via empty state button
- **Manual Backup Validation**: Treat missing database file as error during manual backup to prevent false success toast

### Performance

- **Session Panel Loading**: Parallel directory scanning and head-tail JSONL reading for Codex, OpenClaw, and OpenCode session providers
- **Query Cache Cleanup**: Removed unnecessary TanStack Query cache overhead for Tauri local IPC calls

### Documentation

- **Sponsors**: Added/updated SSSAiCode, Crazyrouter, AICoding, Right Code, and MiniMax sponsor entries across all README languages

- Extend the Codex provider wizard with display name, dedicated API key URL, and clearer guidance
- Introduce shared common config snippets with JSON/TOML reuse, validation, and consistent error surfaces

### 🔧 Improvements

- Keep the tray menu responsive when the window is hidden and standardize button styling and copy
- Disable modal backdrop blur on Linux (WebKitGTK/Wayland) to avoid freezes; restore the window when clicking the macOS Dock icon
- Support overriding config directories on WSL, refine placeholders/descriptions, and fix VS Code button wrapping on Windows
- Add a `created_at` timestamp to provider records for future sorting and analytics

### 🐛 Fixes

- Correct regex escapes and common snippet trimming in the Codex wizard to prevent validation issues
- Harden the VS Code sync flow with more reliable TOML/JSON parsing while reducing layout jank
- Bundle `@codemirror/lint` to reinstate live linting in config editors

### 📦 Dependencies

- **Tauri**: 2.8.2
- **React**: 18.2.0
- **TypeScript**: 5.3.0

### 🔄 Migration Notes

For users upgrading from v2.x (Electron version):

- Configuration files remain compatible - no action required
- The app will automatically migrate your existing provider configurations
- Window position and size preferences have been reset to defaults

#### Backup on v1→v2 Migration (cc-switch internal config)

- When the app detects an old v1 config structure at `~/.cc-switch/config.json`, it now creates a timestamped backup before writing the new v2 structure.
- Backup location: `~/.cc-switch/config.v1.backup.<timestamp>.json`
- This only concerns cc-switch's own metadata file; your actual provider files under `~/.claude/` and `~/.codex/` are untouched.

### 🛠️ Development

- Added `pnpm typecheck` command for TypeScript validation
- Added `pnpm format` and `pnpm format:check` for code formatting
- Rust code now uses cargo fmt for consistent formatting
